Two males were near the spring, alternately eating berries from a tree above the path.  Photos attached.  One was singing in the bushes about 50 ft back while the other was feeding, and alternately flying over the circle to the pines on Portola Street.   There was also one BHGR present with them.   Quite surprised to find a third bird very close to my car in the forested area directly below the end of Quarry Road (where I parked).  This was also a male that was closely associated with another Black-headed Grosbeak.  Pretty sure it wasn't one of the two birds at the spring.

Standing alone.  Light grey breast and belly, black tail, grey wings, white supercilium, typical godwit bill.   -- (from NBB)  Hi Ken,  I guess I was the last person to report the Hudsonian Godwit on eBird, on September 24th. It took me a while to find it, so I thought I'd describe its general location in case you go up there this weekend.  I went up there on the morning of the 23rd, but immediately had to turn around and get back to SF to handle an urgent matter. On that morning there were six Pectoral Sandpipers together in the small holding pond to the north of the tracks. The Godwit was not visible from the railroad tracks and I didn't have time to look further.  I got back up there on the 24th around 9AM. The bird was NOT visible from the tracks nor the road (where construction is happening). Eventually I walked east on the tracks about 1000', past the ranch buildings. Then I cut through a break in the fence and walked south across the field. I'm not sure how cool that is, but there was a hunting regulation sign that didn't say anything against entering. The Godwit was visible after walking south a few hundred feet. It was in the farthest pond (the SE one of the pond complex) standing in a narrows area.",,,,"Limosa haemastica",hudgod,Species,5831.0,,,5.0,2,committed,,"https://ebird.org/profile/MjMwNjE0",1005,1512,"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/96771481","https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S15247835","https://ebird.org/species/hudgod",false,"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/",hudgod

Family reported earlier in the day, did not see adults.  I got down to the Presidio around 5pm this evening.  With David Tomb, we were able to pretty quickly get on what appears to be a recently fledged Lawrence’s Goldfinch.  (Someone please correct me if I’m wrong!). Note the white in the tail, the yellow already coming in on the wing, the pale head and large bill - all of which I think safely separate this from the other finches.  We stayed with this bird for about ten minutes and then it flew off with another (possibly juvenile, possibly adult female.). This was at the coordinates that Lee Hong-Chang gave in the first post.  Over the next hour I was unable to get on any other LAGOs - though I heard the tinkle call a few times.  It was difficult with the high winds and the literally hundred plus House Finch, Lesser Goldfinch, juncos, song and WC sparrows, and Hooded Orioles flying around.  This area seems to be a breeding frenzy.   You should also check the trees in a little gully about 100 yards north of the spot (not accessible by any main trail) where I last heard the LAGO call.  Are there any other breeding records of this bird in San Francisco in modern times?",,,,"Spinus lawrencei",lawgol,Species,31381.0,,,5.0,2,committed,,"https://ebird.org/profile/MjMwNjE0",1600,2400,"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/245788621","https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S70844481","https://ebird.org/species/lawgol",false,"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/",lawgol

At first seeing it in only silhouette I was struck by its long thin bill and long dark tail, thought I might be looking at a gnatcatcher for a second.  Walked around to the bare tree where it was perching in the back.  Bird seemed to stick around for a couple of minutes at a time and then disappear for 10-15 minutes.   Though I assumed Gray, I ended up walking up the hill and down a treacherous, but busy, footpath over the tree so I could get better documentation.   Uniformly gray head, auricular and back with no contrast.  Whitish throat and faint yellow on belly.   From certain angles the auricular patch seemed to stand out - the lores extensive white, and has distinctive white tuft at the base of upper mandible, which I understand helps separate Gray from Dusky.   The most definitive characteristic is the oversize thin bill, black upper mandible, yellow lower slightly darker at the tip.  If not for the size of the bill I think this would be hard to separate visually from Dusky.  Head is rounded with a slight hint of a peak to the back.   Wings and tail feathers have a weathered look in the photos with spread-wings - not sure where this would be in the molt cycle, doesn't seem complete.    Wings are comparatively short, with wingtips and rest not extending as far as undertail coverts.  Tail dark.  I think the size, shape, color of bill, length of wingtips, and head shape cinch this as a Gray vs. Hammonds/Dusky.  Bird gave out a soft ""chewit""-like dry whit call.  Pumped tail downward a bit, but not excessively.  I did not use playback.  Bird did not strike me as being particularly larger than the other empids.",,,,"Empidonax wrightii",gryfly,Species,16192.0,,,5.0,2,committed,,"https://ebird.org/profile/MjMwNjE0",1600,2400,"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/232218381","https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S68634732","https://ebird.org/species/gryfly",false,"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/",gryfly

Small Sparrow sized-bird appeared very tame -  observed feeding for about 15 minutes on berm on the northern side of the great field.  Appears to be a young (first fall?) female.  Numerous field marks to separate from similar Chestnut-collared.  Note large pink bill with black tip.  Pale face with plain auriculars around unremarkable ear covert.  Wide pale supercilium - overall head color somewhat reminiscent of a female House Sparrow.  Bird had a buffy collar similar to head and not ""chestnut.  Notable buffy breast-plate with barely any streaking coming to a crisp transition.  Breast patch remarkably similar in shape to that of the black breast patch of an adult male McCowns.  Median coverts were darker than other feathers - good field mark, though not as dark as an immature male, led me to think this is female.  Bird in flight had wide white patches on outer rectices.  Flew short-distances (20-50 meters) at low height - unlike a LALO.  Only called in flight.

Adult male, in the thick willow riparian near the junction of Steam Trail x Eucalyptus Trail.   For the first half hour I heard the 'basic' song exactly three times from the far side of the stream perhaps 100 yards through dense thicket from the trail - I also repeatedly heard a short four-note call that I was not familiar with that sounded like the last four notes of the basic song.  Pretty sure that is the same bird.   Finally he decided to check out my pishing (no play-back) and flew over to me - for the next 15 minutes or so he sang repeatedly from perches around the trail.  Hooded Warblers are strong confident flyers in the understory with a clear loud song.",,,,"Setophaga citrina",hoowar,Species,31730.0,,,4.5,2,committed,,"https://ebird.org/profile/MjMwNjE0",1066,1600,"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/30719431","https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S30463500","https://ebird.org/species/hoowar",false,"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/",hoowar

At first seeing it in only silhouette I was struck by its long thin bill and long dark tail, thought I might be looking at a gnatcatcher for a second.  Walked around to the bare tree where it was perching in the back.  Bird seemed to stick around for a couple of minutes at a time and then disappear for 10-15 minutes.   Though I assumed Gray, I ended up walking up the hill and down a treacherous, but busy, footpath over the tree so I could get better documentation.   Uniformly gray head, auricular and back with no contrast.  Whitish throat and faint yellow on belly.   From certain angles the auricular patch seemed to stand out - the lores extensive white, and has distinctive white tuft at the base of upper mandible, which I understand helps separate Gray from Dusky.   The most definitive characteristic is the oversize thin bill, black upper mandible, yellow lower slightly darker at the tip.  If not for the size of the bill I think this would be hard to separate visually from Dusky.  Head is rounded with a slight hint of a peak to the back.   Wings and tail feathers have a weathered look in the photos with spread-wings - not sure where this would be in the molt cycle, doesn't seem complete.    Wings are comparatively short, with wingtips and rest not extending as far as undertail coverts.  Tail dark.  I think the size, shape, color of bill, length of wingtips, and head shape cinch this as a Gray vs. Hammonds/Dusky.  Bird gave out a soft ""chewit""-like dry whit call.  Pumped tail downward a bit, but not excessively.  I did not use playback.  Bird did not strike me as being particularly larger than the other empids.",,,,"Empidonax wrightii",gryfly,Species,16192.0,,,4.5,2,committed,,"https://ebird.org/profile/MjMwNjE0",1600,2400,"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/232218361","https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S68634732","https://ebird.org/species/gryfly",false,"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/",gryfly

Numerous field marks to separate from similar Chestnut-collared.  Note large pink bill with black tip.  Pale face with plain auriculars around unremarkable ear covert.  Wide pale supercilium - overall head color somewhat reminiscent of a female House Sparrow.  Bird had a buffy collar similar to head and not ""chestnut.  Notable buffy breast-plate with barely any streaking coming to a crisp transition.  Breast patch remarkably similar in shape to that of the black breast patch of an adult male McCowns.  Median coverts were darker than other feathers - good field mark, though not as dark as an immature male, led me to think this is female.  Bird in flight had wide white patches on outer rectices.

Then he goes out and quickly finds a first county record Mourning Warbler. I arrived at about 12:40pm and searched with him and Judi Sierra for about 40 minutes until we refound it. The bird is very secretive (like all MOWA as far as I know) and tended to stay in about a 100 ft radius of heavy riparian willow, thick clumps of grass and low branches.  Was feeding on the ground or lowest branches, never seen more than about 24"" off the ground.  Did not allow particularly close approach. Juvenal plumage - presumed first year - sex indeterminate. Gray head, narrow white broken eye-ring ""eye arcs"" - fully broken by dark horizontal line.   The throat is off-white directly at the base of the lower mandible, but otherwise yellow.  Gray broken breast-band does not form a complete hood as MGWA (MacGillivray's) would.  Breast and underparts a convincing bright yellow that gave it an overall feel of n OCWA/. Tail seemed notably short.   Although 1st winter MOWA and MGWA are similar, I feel that the presence of yellow superloral, yellow throat, and thin eye arcs cinch the ID.  Bird behavior was also MOWA like, skulking and staying low to the ground or on dirt at all times. The creek makes up the county line.  When I arrived Noah had seen it on both sides of the creek (he initially found it bathing).  We refound it on the Contra Costa side where it stayed for about an hour - only allowing a few open views.  As I was leaving, Derek Heins refound the bird on the Alameda side, where it stayed at the water's edge for some time.",,,,"Geothlypis philadelphia",mouwar,Species,32724.0,,,3.5,2,committed,,"https://ebird.org/profile/MjMwNjE0",1601,2400,"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/177538331","https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S59868166","https://ebird.org/species/mouwar",false,"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/",mouwar

The location was in the section of the cemetery that is south of El Camino Real, almost exactly where the Vermilion Flycatcher spent the winter of 2016-17.  This stretch is pretty birdy with flycatchers and thrushes.  The Tropical Kingbird was wide ranging, but came back several times to a perch near the top of a small yew(?) with dead branches on top.  He was also chased away a bit by the bluebirds, which were the only birds that seemed to mind his presence.  The yew tree was here 37.669597, -122.456826 though the flycatcher used the whole lawn.  Chris Hayward was nearby and we were able to refine the bird pretty quickly when he arrived.  Chris told me that Laurie Graham had one here in December, so I figure this bird has overwintered here.  Chris and I saw it fly off to the distance (toward the north), but I’ll bet it returns here frequently.",,,,"Tyrannus melancholicus",trokin,Species,16674.0,,,4.0,1,committed,,"https://ebird.org/profile/MjMwNjE0",1920,2880,"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/213481561","https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S65440593","https://ebird.org/species/trokin",false,"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/",trokin

Approximately the size of Lesser Yellowlegs but somewhat more slender.   Very pale white belly and head, medium gray wings with some mottling (from a distance) but not the intricate feather pattern of a yellowlegs sp.   Seems to indicate some alternate plumage wing feathers coming in.  I wonder if this bird is molting-in-migration or if it has been here all winter.    The bird was not associating with other tringa, and seemed to squabble a few times with American Avocet.   Bird has an interesting side to side sweeping motion when foraging in shallow water, reminiscent of an Avocet.  Bill is needle thin and straight.  Long thin gray legs.

Spotted by Aaron Maizlish, Jared Dawson, Kathleen Boehm-Dawson.   The bird was flycatching actively.  We observed it for about seven minutes, it moved perches several times.

It is about the size of a Least Sandpiper - considerably smaller than a Western.   The bill is short and slightly drooped with a distinct gape notch.   The legs are black and completely unwebbed (un-palmated).  They appear long relative to body size.  The most striking diagnostic feature are the rich rufous edges on the tertials that are coming in, along with one or two rufous scapulars.  The feathers have a black shaft and rufous edging.  Otherwise the bird was much greyer than the Western Sandpipers.    The scapulars have a solid blackish appearance.  The face has a ""split"" supercilium that I understand distinguishes it from the other stints - basically a forked eyebrow, that is visible in one of the photos.     In the hour that we were there the bird showed amazing fidelity to one particular spot in the middle of the pond, returning to it over and over to feed in water that was about one inch deep., and defending his space. We watched him get chased around a bit by an aggressive avocet.  Our view was from 125'.  There are 23 previous records in California - all but one between July and December.  There is just one spring record in May 1991 on the Salton Sea.",,,,"Calidris minuta",litsti,Species,5890.0,,,3.0,1,committed,,"https://ebird.org/profile/MjMwNjE0",1066,1600,"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/27476711","https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S29133497","https://ebird.org/species/litsti",false,"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/",litsti

Approximately the size of Lesser Yellowlegs but somewhat more slender.   Very pale white belly and head, medium gray wings with some mottling (from a distance) but not the intricate feather pattern of a yellowlegs sp.   Seems to indicate some alternate plumage wing feathers coming in.  I wonder if this bird is molting-in-migration or if it has been here all winter.    The bird was not associating with other tringa, and seemed to squabble a few times with American Avocet.   Bird has an interesting side to side sweeping motion when foraging in shallow water, reminiscent of an Avocet.  Bill is needle thin and straight.  Long thin gray legs.

But I did get good looks at it initially and also in flight, and was confident in my ID. Small warbler - similar to Townsend's but with a more compact elongated shape and a more direct flight style.  Head not as rounded as Townsend's.  Bird appears to be 1st winter.   Wide unbroken white wing bars and a black back that matched the wings, not gray (TOWA) or Green (CERW).  I did not get a good look at any detail ""braces"" on the back and the poor photos don't show anything, but the color was definitive.   Yellow wash extends unbroken acros the throat and breast almost to the legs.  Streaked on flanks, not excessively.   Head has the typical gray triangular auriculars of a Blackburnian, but not very well defined in the back, which was smudgy yellow and gray.

The bird is very secretive (like all MOWA as far as I know) and tended to stay in about a 100 ft radius of heavy riparian willow, thick clumps of grass and low branches.  Was feeding on the ground or lowest branches, never seen more than about 24"" off the ground.  Did not allow particularly close approach. Juvenal plumage - presumed first year - sex indeterminate. Gray head, narrow white broken eye-ring ""eye arcs"" - fully broken by dark horizontal line.   The throat is off-white directly at the base of the lower mandible, but otherwise yellow.  Gray broken breast-band does not form a complete hood as MGWA (MacGillivray's) would.  Breast and underparts a convincing bright yellow that gave it an overall feel of n OCWA/. Tail seemed notably short.   Although 1st winter MOWA and MGWA are similar, I feel that the presence of yellow superloral, yellow throat, and thin eye arcs cinch the ID.  Bird behavior was also MOWA like, skulking and staying low to the ground or on dirt at all times. The creek makes up the county line.

Found at about 9:45 am, as seen from the wood pedestrian bridge.  On the island with approximately 1,000 Elegant Terns - but more associated with a few Least Sandpipers and staying away from the terns.  Medium-sized shorebird, larger than pectoral, small than knot.   Had a very dumpy posture, not uncommon for juveniles, almost like a Green Heron when its head is down.   Bold, plain dark scapular feathers - which is the first thing I notice with Ruffs, with wide buffy fringes, all feathers appearing even aged.  Head and neck were dull buff color, no streaking on breast or belly.  Thin dark slightly-decurved ""Dunlin-type"" bill.  Dull green-yellow  ""Willet-like"" legs.  Head appears small for body, giving a hunched appearance when feeding.  Floppy rear wing feathers (extended tertials?) also diagnostic.",,,,"Calidris pugnax",ruff,Species,5855.0,,,3.0,1,committed,,"https://ebird.org/profile/MjMwNjE0",1920,2880,"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/174288171","https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S59279986","https://ebird.org/species/ruff",false,"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/",ruff

It was called out that “a close storm-petrel” was in front of the boat so those on the bow could get photos and identify it. The consensus of some in the bow was a dark-rumped Leach's, but they were troubled by some of the field marks. A dark-rumped chapmani Leach’s was trailing the bird in question so that may have caused some confusion. Those birds passed the bow quickly.  The bird was gone so fast as storm-petrels do and we were approaching the large flock so we were on to the next thing. Upon reviewing photos the following day, David Pereksta was alarmed when he saw the details of this bird and suspected it could be a Tristram's Storm-Petrel.  A robust-looking sooty-colored storm-petrel with pale back and rump, deeply forked tail, bright carpal bars, and contrastingly dark head. In addition, other photos show it apparently gliding on slightly bowed wings. The underside was uniformly dark including the underwings. The carpal bars were very pale at the base along the inner trailing edge of the wings, indicating a fresh juvenile. The primary shafts appeared bare, but this species has dark shafts that can reflect silvery under certain lighting conditions. Joel Barrett’s photos with the Leach’s in the same frame show a shocking size difference with the bird in question being much larger and more robust. The overwhelming consensus of seabird experts consulted is that the bird is a Tristram's Storm-Petrel.  This bird was seen 19 nautical miles NNW from San Nicolas island (GPS coordinates: 33,35,20.88000, 119,38,51.79200).",,,,"Oceanodroma tristrami",trspet,Species,6637.0,,,3.0,1,committed,,"https://ebird.org/profile/MjMwNjE0",800,1200,"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/114159041","https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S47537226","https://ebird.org/species/trspet",false,"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/",trspet

But I did get good looks at it initially and also in flight, and was confident in my ID. Small warbler - similar to Townsend's but with a more compact elongated shape and a more direct flight style.  Head not as rounded as Townsend's.  Bird appears to be 1st winter.   Wide unbroken white wing bars and a black back that matched the wings, not gray (TOWA) or Green (CERW).  I did not get a good look at any detail ""braces"" on the back and the poor photos don't show anything, but the color was definitive.   Yellow wash extends unbroken acros the throat and breast almost to the legs.  Streaked on flanks, not excessively.   Head has the typical gray triangular auriculars of a Blackburnian, but not very well defined in the back, which was smudgy yellow and gray.   Defining feature is the lengthy yellow supercilium extending all the way to the nape, and the lower eye crescent that appears white in the photos.   Combination of all of these traits ufficient to eliminate TOWA.  A couple things bother me about this bird however.  The photos seem to show a long tail with extendsive black on the sides, which is somewhat forked, kind of like a Parula.   None of this looks typical for either BLWA nor TOWA.

The legs are black and completely unwebbed (un-palmated).  They appear long relative to body size.

The face has a ""split"" supercilium that I understand distinguishes it from the other stints - basically a forked eyebrow, that is visible in one of the photos.     In the hour that we were there the bird showed amazing fidelity to one particular spot in the middle of the pond, returning to it over and over to feed in water that was about one inch deep., and defending his space.

Refound the bird with Pat Kenny, Roland, and one other birder whose name I didn't get.  Was very active around the east end of the green lawn.   First saw in flight with pipits, smaller, more distinctive face pattern and very wide white outer rectices, quite noticable in flight.  Flew up to small hill, where we found it on 3 different occasions near the top of the ridge.  Also seen briefly on the lawn and in the large grassy ""overflow parking"" area.  My impression is that the bird is mellower  when foraging than the pipits, but tends to take off with the flock when the pipits get edgy.  I think it would be approachable, though I only had 4 distant and brief views.  I stuck around for an hour afterward hoping to get a better photo, but was unable to refind, even though the pipits continued to come and go.",,,,"Calcarius ornatus",chclon,Species,30392.0,,,1.0,1,committed,,"https://ebird.org/profile/MjMwNjE0",1068,1601,"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/123557831","https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S49934184","https://ebird.org/species/chclon",false,"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/",chclon

My impression is that the bird is mellower  when foraging than the pipits, but tends to take off with the flock when the pipits get edgy.

Then he goes out and quickly finds a first county record Mourning Warbler. I arrived at about 12:40pm and searched with him and Judi Sierra for about 40 minutes until we refound it. The bird is very secretive (like all MOWA as far as I know) and tended to stay in about a 100 ft radius of heavy riparian willow, thick clumps of grass and low branches.  Was feeding on the ground or lowest branches, never seen more than about 24"" off the ground.  Did not allow particularly close approach. Juvenal plumage - presumed first year - sex indeterminate. Gray head, narrow white broken eye-ring ""eye arcs"" - fully broken by dark horizontal line.   The throat is off-white directly at the base of the lower mandible, but otherwise yellow.  Gray broken breast-band does not form a complete hood as MGWA (MacGillivray's) would.  Breast and underparts a convincing bright yellow that gave it an overall feel of n OCWA/. Tail seemed notably short.   Although 1st winter MOWA and MGWA are similar, I feel that the presence of yellow superloral, yellow throat, and thin eye arcs cinch the ID.  Bird behavior was also MOWA like, skulking and staying low to the ground or on dirt at all times. The creek makes up the county line.

Some may have seen the bird as it lifted up from the far-left side of the flock and several photographers discovered the bird in their images; most notably Aaron Maizlish and Larry Sansone. This bird was noticeable smaller than the other storm-petrels. The bird was black and appeared to be in heavy wing molt. A large triangular white rump patch extending almost to the end of the tail was evident, unlike the rump of a Townsend's. The bird also had a short thick bill, steep forehead, and no pronounced carpal bars. The deep wingbeats in the photos are also consistent with Wedge-rumped. Upon reviewing the photos, Steve Howell noted that the molting wings are consistent with Wedge-rumped at this season; this molt is not typical of Townsend’s at this season. The consensus among several of the leaders and other seabird experts that were consulted in the following days was that this individual was indeed a Wedge-rumped Storm-Petrel. This bird was in view for only a few seconds and was gone quickly as the flock dispersed.  This bird was seen 19 nautical miles NNW from San Nicolas island (GPS coordinates: 33,35,7.2240, 119,38,39.92399).",,,,"Oceanodroma tethys",wrspet,Species,6629.0,,,0.0,0,committed,,"https://ebird.org/profile/MjMwNjE0",662,997,"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/109249401","https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S47537226","https://ebird.org/species/wrspet",false,"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/",wrspet
