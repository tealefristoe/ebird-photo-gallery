Found at about 9:45 am, as seen from the wood pedestrian bridge.  On the island with approximately 1,000 Elegant Terns - but more associated with a few Least Sandpipers and staying away from the terns.  Medium-sized shorebird, larger than pectoral, small than knot.   Had a very dumpy posture, not uncommon for juveniles, almost like a Green Heron when its head is down.   Bold, plain dark scapular feathers - which is the first thing I notice with Ruffs, with wide buffy fringes, all feathers appearing even aged.  Head and neck were dull buff color, no streaking on breast or belly.  Thin dark slightly-decurved \"Dunlin-type\" bill.  Dull green-yellow  \"Willet-like\" legs.  Head appears small for body, giving a hunched appearance when feeding.
