Apparent first year bird judging by crisp feathers on breast, even wear and white edging.  Some yellow on cheek, behind eye and sides of neck.  Golden flecking down the length of the back but otherwise dull primaries and secondaries, heavily worn.  Bill heavier than American.  Primary extensions appear long and there was some discussion about American.

Standing alone.  Light grey breast and belly, black tail, grey wings, white supercilium, typical godwit bill.   -- (from NBB)  Hi Ken,  I guess I was the last person to report the Hudsonian Godwit on eBird, on September 24th. It took me a while to find it, so I thought I'd describe its general location in case you go up there this weekend.  I went up there on the morning of the 23rd, but immediately had to turn around and get back to SF to handle an urgent matter. On that morning there were six Pectoral Sandpipers together in the small holding pond to the north of the tracks. The Godwit was not visible from the railroad tracks and I didn't have time to look further.  I got back up there on the 24th around 9AM. The bird was NOT visible from the tracks nor the road (where construction is happening). Eventually I walked east on the tracks about 1000', past the ranch buildings. Then I cut through a break in the fence and walked south across the field. I'm not sure how cool that is, but there was a hunting regulation sign that didn't say anything against entering. The Godwit was visible after walking south a few hundred feet. It was in the farthest pond (the SE one of the pond complex) standing in a narrows area.","Class":"","Order":"","Family":"","Parent Species":"Limosa haemastica","eBird Species Code":"hudgod","Taxon

Found at about 9:45 am, as seen from the wood pedestrian bridge.  On the island with approximately 1,000 Elegant Terns - but more associated with a few Least Sandpipers and staying away from the terns.  Medium-sized shorebird, larger than pectoral, small than knot.   Had a very dumpy posture, not uncommon for juveniles, almost like a Green Heron when its head is down.   Bold, plain dark scapular feathers - which is the first thing I notice with Ruffs, with wide buffy fringes, all feathers appearing even aged.  Head and neck were dull buff color, no streaking on breast or belly.  Thin dark slightly-decurved \"Dunlin-type\" bill.  Dull green-yellow  \"Willet-like\" legs.

It is about the size of a Least Sandpiper - considerably smaller than a Western.   The bill is short and slightly drooped with a distinct gape notch.   The legs are black and completely unwebbed (un-palmated).  They appear long relative to body size.  The most striking diagnostic feature are the rich rufous edges on the tertials that are coming in, along with one or two rufous scapulars.  The feathers have a black shaft and rufous edging.  Otherwise the bird was much greyer than the Western Sandpipers.    The scapulars have a solid blackish appearance.  The face has a \"split\" supercilium that I understand distinguishes it from the other stints - basically a forked eyebrow, that is visible in one of the photos.

Approximately the size of Lesser Yellowlegs but somewhat more slender.   Very pale white belly and head, medium gray wings with some mottling (from a distance) but not the intricate feather pattern of a yellowlegs sp.   Seems to indicate some alternate plumage wing feathers coming in.  I wonder if this bird is molting-in-migration or if it has been here all winter.    The bird was not associating with other tringa, and seemed to squabble a few times with American Avocet.   Bird has an interesting side to side sweeping motion when foraging in shallow water, reminiscent of an Avocet.  Bill is needle thin and straight.  Long thin gray legs.
