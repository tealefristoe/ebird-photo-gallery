Some may have seen the bird as it lifted up from the far-left side of the flock and several photographers discovered the bird in their images; most notably Aaron Maizlish and Larry Sansone. This bird was noticeable smaller than the other storm-petrels. The bird was black and appeared to be in heavy wing molt. A large triangular white rump patch extending almost to the end of the tail was evident, unlike the rump of a Townsend's. The bird also had a short thick bill, steep forehead, and no pronounced carpal bars. The deep wingbeats in the photos are also consistent with Wedge-rumped. Upon reviewing the photos, Steve Howell noted that the molting wings are consistent with Wedge-rumped at this season; this molt is not typical of Townsend’s at this season. The consensus among several of the leaders and other seabird experts that were consulted in the following days was that this individual was indeed a Wedge-rumped Storm-Petrel. This bird was in view for only a few seconds and was gone quickly as the flock dispersed.  This bird was seen 19 nautical miles NNW from San Nicolas island (GPS coordinates: 33,35,7.2240, 119,38,39.92399).","Class":"","Order":"","Family":"","Parent Species":"Oceanodroma tethys","eBird Species Code":"wrspet","Taxon Category":"Species","Taxonomic Sort":"6629.0","Recordist 2 Display Name":"","Recordist 2 Profile URL":"","Average Community Rating":"0.0","Number of Ratings":"0","Asset State":"committed","Asset Tags":"","Contributor Profile URL":"https://ebird.org/profile/MjMwNjE0","Original Image Height":"662","Original Image Width":"997","Specimen Page URL":"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/109249401","eBird Checklist URL":"https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S47537226","ebird Species URL":"https://ebird.org/species/wrspet","isInternalUser":"false","mediaDownloadUrl":"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/","report_as":"wrspet"}],"Species":"Wedge-rumped Storm-Petrel"},{"photos":[{"ML Catalog Number":"97695441","Format":"Photo","Scientific Name":"Oceanodroma melania","Common Name":"Black Storm-Petrel","Background Species":"","Recordist":"Aaron Maizlish","Date":"9/20/2014","Year":"2014","Month":"9","Day":"20","Time":"1200","Country":"United States","Country-State-County":"US-CA-081","State":"California","County":"San Mateo","Locality":"37.2905x-122.9276 - Sep 20, 2014, 12:00 PM","Latitude":"37.2905","Longitude":"-122.9276","Elevation (m)":"","Age/Sex":"Unknown","Behaviors":"","Playback":"Unspecified","Collected":"","Specimen ID":"","Home Archive Catalog Number":"","Recorder":"","Microphone":"","Accessory":"","Partner Institution":"","eBird Checklist ID":"S19913103","Unconfirmed?":"","Air Temp(ºC)":"","Water Temp(ºC)":"","Media notes":"","Observation Details":"Distant","Class":"","Order":"","Family":"","Parent Species":"Oceanodroma melania","eBird Species Code":"bkspet","Taxon Category":"Species","Taxonomic Sort":"6632.0","Recordist 2 Display Name":"","Recordist 2 Profile URL":"","Average Community Rating":"2.0","Number of Ratings":"1","Asset State":"committed","Asset Tags":"","Contributor Profile URL":"https://ebird.org/profile/MjMwNjE0","Original Image Height":"801","Original Image Width":"1202","Specimen Page URL":"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/97695441","eBird Checklist URL":"https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S19913103","ebird Species URL":"https://ebird.org/species/bkspet","isInternalUser":"false","mediaDownloadUrl":"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/","report_as":"bkspet"}],"Species":"Black Storm-Petrel"},{"photos":[{"ML Catalog Number":"114159041","Format":"Photo","Scientific Name":"Oceanodroma tristrami","Common Name":"Tristram's Storm-Petrel","Background Species":"","Recordist":"Aaron Maizlish","Date":"7/15/2018","Year":"2018","Month":"7","Day":"15","Time":"1215","Country":"United States","Country-State-County":"US-CA-111","State":"California","County":"Ventura","Locality":"Pelagic.

It was called out that “a close storm-petrel” was in front of the boat so those on the bow could get photos and identify it. The consensus of some in the bow was a dark-rumped Leach's, but they were troubled by some of the field marks. A dark-rumped chapmani Leach’s was trailing the bird in question so that may have caused some confusion. Those birds passed the bow quickly.  The bird was gone so fast as storm-petrels do and we were approaching the large flock so we were on to the next thing. Upon reviewing photos the following day, David Pereksta was alarmed when he saw the details of this bird and suspected it could be a Tristram's Storm-Petrel.  A robust-looking sooty-colored storm-petrel with pale back and rump, deeply forked tail, bright carpal bars, and contrastingly dark head. In addition, other photos show it apparently gliding on slightly bowed wings. The underside was uniformly dark including the underwings. The carpal bars were very pale at the base along the inner trailing edge of the wings, indicating a fresh juvenile. The primary shafts appeared bare, but this species has dark shafts that can reflect silvery under certain lighting conditions. Joel Barrett’s photos with the Leach’s in the same frame show a shocking size difference with the bird in question being much larger and more robust. The overwhelming consensus of seabird experts consulted is that the bird is a Tristram's Storm-Petrel.  This bird was seen 19 nautical miles NNW from San Nicolas island (GPS coordinates: 33,35,20.88000, 119,38,51.79200).","Class":"","Order":"","Family":"","Parent Species":"Oceanodroma tristrami","eBird Species Code":"trspet","Taxon Category":"Species","Taxonomic Sort":"6637.0","Recordist 2 Display Name":"","Recordist 2 Profile URL":"","Average Community Rating":"3.0","Number of Ratings":"1","Asset State":"committed","Asset Tags":"","Contributor Profile URL":"https://ebird.org/profile/MjMwNjE0","Original Image Height":"800","Original Image Width":"1200","Specimen Page URL":"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/114159041","eBird Checklist URL":"https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S47537226","ebird Species URL":"https://ebird.org/species/trspet","isInternalUser":"false","mediaDownloadUrl":"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/","report_as":"trspet"}],"Species":"Tristram's Storm-Petrel"},{"photos":[{"ML Catalog Number":"97628901","Format":"Photo","Scientific Name":"Fulmarus glacialis","Common Name":"Northern Fulmar","Background Species":"","Recordist":"Aaron Maizlish","Date":"1/15/2014","Year":"2014","Month":"1","Day":"15","Time":"800","Country":"United States","Country-State-County":"US-CA-081","State":"California","County":"San Mateo","Locality":"Pacifica Municipal Pier","Latitude":"37.6334","Longitude":"-122.498","Elevation (m)":"","Age/Sex":"Unknown","Behaviors":"","Playback":"Unspecified","Collected":"","Specimen ID":"","Home Archive Catalog Number":"","Recorder":"","Microphone":"","Accessory":"","Partner Institution":"","eBird Checklist ID":"S16380588","Unconfirmed?":"","Air Temp(ºC)":"","Water Temp(ºC)":"","Media notes":"","Observation Details":"Close to pier.
