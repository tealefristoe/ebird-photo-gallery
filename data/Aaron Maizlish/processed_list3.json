I went to look for it the next morning, but it was not seen again for several days.  Quite surprisingly the owl returned to the exact same spot on August 5th when I was able to see and photograph it.  The bird appears to be in juvenile plumage, with fresh crisp feathers pre-molt.  It stayed immobilized about 10' off of the sidewalk in a dark spot in the tree.  Surprisingly there do not appear to be any summer records in eBird of Saw-whets, only winter sightings ranging from 11/13 to 4/09.  Hard to say whether this bird bred locally or is ranging widely post-dispersal.   Saw-whets breed on the peninsula, starting at La Honda - but maybe closer in the Crystal Springs watershed (?), as well as to the north at Mt Tam and in small numbers in the Berkeley Hills.  Do juveniles typically wander 20+ miles prior to molt and feed on their own?  And would it stay in place for at least six days?  It seems equally likely that there was an undetected successful nesting in the general area.  There are mature trees in the neighborhood, but no closed canopy forest.  Mystery worth considering, especially if this bird shows up again.","Class":"","Order":"","Family":"","Parent Species":"Aegolius acadicus","eBird Species Code":"nswowl","Taxon Category":"Species","Taxonomic Sort":"8777.0","Recordist 2 Display Name":"","Recordist 2 Profile URL":"","Average Community Rating":"3.6666666666666665","Number of Ratings":"3","Asset State":"committed","Asset Tags":"","Contributor Profile URL":"https://ebird.org/profile/MjMwNjE0","Original Image Height":"3600","Original Image Width":"2700","Specimen Page URL":"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/255047091","eBird Checklist URL":"https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S72333404","ebird Species URL":"https://ebird.org/species/nswowl","isInternalUser":"false","mediaDownloadUrl":"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/","report_as":"nswowl"},{"ML Catalog Number":"255047071","Format":"Photo","Scientific Name":"Aegolius acadicus","Common Name":"Northern Saw-whet Owl","Background Species":"","Recordist":"Aaron Maizlish","Date":"8/5/2020","Year":"2020","Month":"8","Day":"5","Time":"805","Country":"United States","Country-State-County":"US-CA-075","State":"California","County":"San Francisco","Locality":"Alabama Street","Latitude":"37.7452","Longitude":"-122.4105","Elevation (m)":"","Age/Sex":"","Behaviors":"","Playback":"Unspecified","Collected":"","Specimen ID":"","Home Archive Catalog Number":"","Recorder":"","Microphone":"","Accessory":"","Partner Institution":"","eBird Checklist ID":"S72333404","Unconfirmed?":"","Air Temp(ºC)":"","Water Temp(ºC)":"","Media notes":"","Observation Details":"This juvenile owl was first spotted by a neighbor who found it day-roosting in a street tree on Alabama Street on July 31st.

This is a hill with a lot of native oaks, some stressed or dead, others looking pretty healthy.  This would seem to be a suitable grove for them to set up for winter.  Bird was apparent adult, caching food in a snag.   Allowed for very close prolonged looks.  Saw a pale juvenile type bird later in a healthy oak tree about 100 yards west - subsequent visitors have confirmed that these are different birds (an adult and a juvenile.)
