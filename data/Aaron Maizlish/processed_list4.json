Spotted by Aaron Maizlish, Jared Dawson, Kathleen Boehm-Dawson.   The bird was flycatching actively.  We observed it for about seven minutes, it moved perches several times.    It responded to Jared's playback, flying down and toward him.  Eventually flew out of sight into the willows to the East.  We were unable to refind him.  The flickr photos are geo-referenced to the exact tree where found.  Though unmistakable as an OS Flycatcher (look at the sharp vest) we wanted to rule out Greater Pewee.

At first seeing it in only silhouette I was struck by its long thin bill and long dark tail, thought I might be looking at a gnatcatcher for a second.  Walked around to the bare tree where it was perching in the back.  Bird seemed to stick around for a couple of minutes at a time and then disappear for 10-15 minutes.   Though I assumed Gray, I ended up walking up the hill and down a treacherous, but busy, footpath over the tree so I could get better documentation.   Uniformly gray head, auricular and back with no contrast.  Whitish throat and faint yellow on belly.   From certain angles the auricular patch seemed to stand out - the lores extensive white, and has distinctive white tuft at the base of upper mandible, which I understand helps separate Gray from Dusky.   The most definitive characteristic is the oversize thin bill, black upper mandible, yellow lower slightly darker at the tip.  If not for the size of the bill I think this would be hard to separate visually from Dusky.  Head is rounded with a slight hint of a peak to the back.   Wings and tail feathers have a weathered look in the photos with spread-wings - not sure where this would be in the molt cycle, doesn't seem complete.    Wings are comparatively short, with wingtips and rest not extending as far as undertail coverts.  Tail dark.  I think the size, shape, color of bill, length of wingtips, and head shape cinch this as a Gray vs. Hammonds/Dusky.  Bird gave out a soft \"chewit\"-like dry whit call.  Pumped tail downward a bit, but not excessively.  I did not use playback.  Bird did not strike me as being particularly larger than the other empids.","Class":"","Order":"","Family":"","Parent Species":"Empidonax wrightii","eBird Species Code":"gryfly","Taxon Category":"Species","Taxonomic Sort":"16192.0","Recordist 2 Display Name":"","Recordist 2 Profile URL":"","Average Community Rating":"5.0","Number of Ratings":"2","Asset State":"committed","Asset Tags":"","Contributor Profile URL":"https://ebird.org/profile/MjMwNjE0","Original Image Height":"1600","Original Image Width":"2400","Specimen Page URL":"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/232218381","eBird Checklist URL":"https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S68634732","ebird Species URL":"https://ebird.org/species/gryfly","isInternalUser":"false","mediaDownloadUrl":"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/","report_as":"gryfly"},{"ML Catalog Number":"97693401","Format":"Photo","Scientific Name":"Empidonax wrightii","Common Name":"Gray Flycatcher","Background Species":"","Recordist":"Aaron Maizlish","Date":"9/10/2014","Year":"2014","Month":"9","Day":"10","Time":"1100","Country":"United States","Country-State-County":"US-CA-041","State":"California","County":"Marin","Locality":"Pt.

Walked around to the bare tree where it was perching in the back.  Bird seemed to stick around for a couple of minutes at a time and then disappear for 10-15 minutes.   Though I assumed Gray, I ended up walking up the hill and down a treacherous, but busy, footpath over the tree so I could get better documentation.   Uniformly gray head, auricular and back with no contrast.  Whitish throat and faint yellow on belly.   From certain angles the auricular patch seemed to stand out - the lores extensive white, and has distinctive white tuft at the base of upper mandible, which I understand helps separate Gray from Dusky.   The most definitive characteristic is the oversize thin bill, black upper mandible, yellow lower slightly darker at the tip.  If not for the size of the bill I think this would be hard to separate visually from Dusky.  Head is rounded with a slight hint of a peak to the back.   Wings and tail feathers have a weathered look in the photos with spread-wings - not sure where this would be in the molt cycle, doesn't seem complete.    Wings are comparatively short, with wingtips and rest not extending as far as undertail coverts.  Tail dark.  I think the size, shape, color of bill, length of wingtips, and head shape cinch this as a Gray vs. Hammonds/Dusky.  Bird gave out a soft \"chewit\"-like dry whit call.  Pumped tail downward a bit, but not excessively.  I did not use playback.  Bird did not strike me as being particularly larger than the other empids.","Class":"","Order":"","Family":"","Parent Species":"Empidonax wrightii","eBird Species Code":"gryfly","Taxon Category":"Species","Taxonomic Sort":"16192.0","Recordist 2 Display Name":"","Recordist 2 Profile URL":"","Average Community Rating":"4.5","Number of Ratings":"2","Asset State":"committed","Asset Tags":"","Contributor Profile URL":"https://ebird.org/profile/MjMwNjE0","Original Image Height":"1600","Original Image Width":"2400","Specimen Page URL":"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/232218361","eBird Checklist URL":"https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S68634732","ebird Species URL":"https://ebird.org/species/gryfly","isInternalUser":"false","mediaDownloadUrl":"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/","report_as":"gryfly"},{"ML Catalog Number":"232218371","Format":"Photo","Scientific Name":"Empidonax wrightii","Common Name":"Gray Flycatcher","Background Species":"","Recordist":"Aaron Maizlish","Date":"5/8/2020","Year":"2020","Month":"5","Day":"8","Time":"1405","Country":"United States","Country-State-County":"US-CA-075","State":"California","County":"San Francisco","Locality":"Bernal Hill","Latitude":"37.7429","Longitude":"-122.4133","Elevation (m)":"","Age/Sex":"","Behaviors":"","Playback":"Unspecified","Collected":"","Specimen ID":"","Home Archive Catalog Number":"","Recorder":"","Microphone":"","Accessory":"","Partner Institution":"","eBird Checklist ID":"S68634732","Unconfirmed?":"","Air Temp(ºC)":"","Water Temp(ºC)":"","Media notes":"","Observation Details":"I found this pale empid at 37.743747, -122.414228 on the north side of Bernal Hill.

Details":"Pen-bird folks,  This afternoon around 2:30pm I found a good looking Tropical Kingbird at the Cypress Lawn Memorial Park in Colma.   The location was in the section of the cemetery that is south of El Camino Real, almost exactly where the Vermilion Flycatcher spent the winter of 2016-17.  This stretch is pretty birdy with flycatchers and thrushes.  The Tropical Kingbird was wide ranging, but came back several times to a perch near the top of a small yew(?) with dead branches on top.  He was also chased away a bit by the bluebirds, which were the only birds that seemed to mind his presence.  The yew tree was here 37.669597, -122.456826 though the flycatcher used the whole lawn.  Chris Hayward was nearby and we were able to refine the bird pretty quickly when he arrived.  Chris told me that Laurie Graham had one here in December, so I figure this bird has overwintered here.  Chris and I saw it fly off to the distance (toward the north), but I’ll bet it returns here frequently.","Class":"","Order":"","Family":"","Parent Species":"Tyrannus melancholicus","eBird Species Code":"trokin","Taxon Category":"Species","Taxonomic Sort":"16674.0","Recordist 2 Display Name":"","Recordist 2 Profile URL":"","Average Community Rating":"4.0","Number of Ratings":"1","Asset State":"committed","Asset Tags":"","Contributor Profile URL":"https://ebird.org/profile/MjMwNjE0","Original Image Height":"1920","Original Image Width":"2880","Specimen Page URL":"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/213481561","eBird Checklist URL":"https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S65440593","ebird Species URL":"https://ebird.org/species/trokin","isInternalUser":"false","mediaDownloadUrl":"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/","report_as":"trokin"},{"ML Catalog Number":"92046541","Format":"Photo","Scientific Name":"Tyrannus melancholicus","Common Name":"Tropical Kingbird","Background Species":"","Recordist":"Aaron Maizlish","Date":"3/26/2018","Year":"2018","Month":"3","Day":"26","Time":"1250","Country":"United States","Country-State-County":"US-CA-075","State":"California","County":"San Francisco","Locality":"West Sunset Playground","Latitude":"37.7489","Longitude":"-122.4981","Elevation (m)":"","Age/Sex":"Unknown","Behaviors":"","Playback":"Unspecified","Collected":"","Specimen ID":"","Home Archive Catalog Number":"","Recorder":"","Microphone":"","Accessory":"","Partner Institution":"","eBird Checklist ID":"S43982877","Unconfirmed?":"","Air Temp(ºC)":"","Water Temp(ºC)":"","Media notes":"","Observation Details":"Wintering bird.
