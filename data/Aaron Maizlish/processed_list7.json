Are there any other breeding records of this bird in San Francisco in modern times?","Class":"","Order":"","Family":"","Parent Species":"Spinus lawrencei","eBird Species Code":"lawgol","Taxon Category":"Species","Taxonomic Sort":"31381.0","Recordist 2 Display Name":"","Recordist 2 Profile URL":"","Average Community Rating":"0.0","Number of Ratings":"0","Asset State":"committed","Asset Tags":"","Contributor Profile URL":"https://ebird.org/profile/MjMwNjE0","Original Image Height":"1600","Original Image Width":"2400","Specimen Page URL":"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/245788611","eBird Checklist URL":"https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S70844481","ebird Species URL":"https://ebird.org/species/lawgol","isInternalUser":"false","mediaDownloadUrl":"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/","report_as":"lawgol"}],"Species":"Lawrence's Goldfinch"},{"photos":[{"ML Catalog Number":"111682381","Format":"Photo","Scientific Name":"Spinus tristis","Common Name":"American Goldfinch","Background Species":"","Recordist":"Aaron Maizlish","Date":"11/9/2012","Year":"2012","Month":"11","Day":"9","Time":"900","Country":"United States","Country-State-County":"US-CA-095","State":"California","County":"Solano","Locality":"Flannery Rd.","Latitude":"38.2126","Longitude":"-121.7701","Elevation (m)":"","Age/Sex":"Unknown","Behaviors":"","Playback":"Unspecified","Collected":"","Specimen ID":"","Home Archive Catalog Number":"","Recorder":"","Microphone":"","Accessory":"","Partner Institution":"","eBird Checklist ID":"S11996622","Unconfirmed?":"","Air Temp(ºC)":"","Water Temp(ºC)":"","Media notes":"","Observation Details":"","Class":"","Order":"","Family":"","Parent Species":"Spinus tristis","eBird Species Code":"amegfi","Taxon Category":"Species","Taxonomic Sort":"31382.0","Recordist 2 Display Name":"","Recordist 2 Profile URL":"","Average Community Rating":"3.6666666666666665","Number of Ratings":"3","Asset State":"committed","Asset Tags":"","Contributor Profile URL":"https://ebird.org/profile/MjMwNjE0","Original Image Height":"1800","Original Image Width":"2400","Specimen Page URL":"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/111682381","eBird Checklist URL":"https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S11996622","ebird Species URL":"https://ebird.org/species/amegfi","isInternalUser":"false","mediaDownloadUrl":"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/","report_as":"amegfi"}],"Species":"American Goldfinch"},{"photos":[{"ML Catalog Number":"85205961","Format":"Photo","Scientific Name":"Spinus magellanicus","Common Name":"Hooded Siskin","Background Species":"","Recordist":"Aaron Maizlish","Date":"12/9/2010","Year":"2010","Month":"12","Day":"9","Time":"1230","Country":"Brazil","Country-State-County":"BR-PR","State":"Paraná","County":"","Locality":"Sao Luis do Purunã","Latitude":"-25.4135","Longitude":"-49.7308","Elevation (m)":"","Age/Sex":"Unknown","Behaviors":"","Playback":"Unspecified","Collected":"","Specimen ID":"","Home Archive Catalog Number":"","Recorder":"","Microphone":"","Accessory":"","Partner Institution":"","eBird Checklist ID":"S11312571","Unconfirmed?":"","Air Temp(ºC)":"","Water Temp(ºC)":"","Media notes":"","Observation Details":"","Class":"","Order":"","Family":"","Parent Species":"Spinus magellanicus","eBird Species Code":"hoosis1","Taxon Category":"Species","Taxonomic Sort":"31401.0","Recordist 2 Display Name":"","Recordist 2 Profile URL":"","Average Community Rating":"2.0","Number of Ratings":"1","Asset State":"committed","Asset Tags":"","Contributor Profile URL":"https://ebird.org/profile/MjMwNjE0","Original Image Height":"1200","Original Image Width":"1800","Specimen Page URL":"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/85205961","eBird Checklist URL":"https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S11312571","ebird Species URL":"https://ebird.org/species/hoosis1","isInternalUser":"false","mediaDownloadUrl":"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/","report_as":"hoosis1"}],"Species":"Hooded Siskin"},{"photos":[{"ML Catalog Number":"119366031","Format":"Photo","Scientific Name":"Calcarius lapponicus","Common Name":"Lapland Longspur","Background Species":"","Recordist":"Aaron Maizlish","Date":"10/17/2018","Year":"2018","Month":"10","Day":"17","Time":"1430","Country":"United States","Country-State-County":"US-CA-001","State":"California","County":"Alameda","Locality":"Hayward Regional Shoreline--Mt.

Small Sparrow sized-bird appeared very tame -  observed feeding for about 15 minutes on berm on the northern side of the great field.  Appears to be a young (first fall?) female.  Numerous field marks to separate from similar Chestnut-collared.  Note large pink bill with black tip.  Pale face with plain auriculars around unremarkable ear covert.  Wide pale supercilium - overall head color somewhat reminiscent of a female House Sparrow.  Bird had a buffy collar similar to head and not \"chestnut.  Notable buffy breast-plate with barely any streaking coming to a crisp transition.  Breast patch remarkably similar in shape to that of the black breast patch of an adult male McCowns.

Details":"One flew from W side of harbor mouth to Jetty on E. Initially spotted by Peter Metropulos. Pished in for better views, and photos were taken. Overall a Savannah Sparrow with greyish tone to back, and very indistinct back streaking. No white \"suspenders\" on upperparts. Similarly underpart streaking dull and not as distinct as on typical Savannah. Overall a long-billed Savannah, but this was less noticeable than the lack of contrast in markings. Extremely rare in Northern California, but Pillar Point Harbor has become a place where sightings have occurred in the last few years. A first, a lifer, for Alvaro! Very exciting to see this from the boat!","Class":"","Order":"","Family":"","Parent Species":"Passerculus sandwichensis","eBird Species Code":"labspa","Taxon Category":"Group","Taxonomic

Adult male, in the thick willow riparian near the junction of Steam Trail x Eucalyptus Trail.   For the first half hour I heard the 'basic' song exactly three times from the far side of the stream perhaps 100 yards through dense thicket from the trail - I also repeatedly heard a short four-note call that I was not familiar with that sounded like the last four notes of the basic song.  Pretty sure that is the same bird.   Finally he decided to check out my pishing (no play-back) and flew over to me - for the next 15 minutes or so he sang repeatedly from perches around the trail.  Hooded Warblers are strong confident flyers in the understory with a clear loud song.","Class":"","Order":"","Family":"","Parent Species":"Setophaga citrina","eBird Species Code":"hoowar","Taxon Category":"Species","Taxonomic Sort":"31730.0","Recordist 2 Display Name":"","Recordist 2 Profile URL":"","Average Community Rating":"4.5","Number of Ratings":"2","Asset State":"committed","Asset Tags":"","Contributor Profile URL":"https://ebird.org/profile/MjMwNjE0","Original Image Height":"1066","Original Image Width":"1600","Specimen Page URL":"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/30719431","eBird Checklist URL":"https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S30463500","ebird Species URL":"https://ebird.org/species/hoowar","isInternalUser":"false","mediaDownloadUrl":"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/","report_as":"hoowar"},{"ML Catalog Number":"232166251","Format":"Photo","Scientific Name":"Setophaga citrina","Common Name":"Hooded Warbler","Background Species":"","Recordist":"Aaron Maizlish","Date":"5/8/2020","Year":"2020","Month":"5","Day":"8","Time":"1100","Country":"United States","Country-State-County":"US-CA-075","State":"California","County":"San Francisco","Locality":"Mt.

It was in a small flock of about 10 Yellow & Townsend's Warblers + 1 BTYW.   I was not able to get a good photo of it, and gave up as it worked its way higher into the cypresses.  But I did get good looks at it initially and also in flight, and was confident in my ID. Small warbler - similar to Townsend's but with a more compact elongated shape and a more direct flight style.  Head not as rounded as Townsend's.  Bird appears to be 1st winter.   Wide unbroken white wing bars and a black back that matched the wings, not gray (TOWA) or Green (CERW).  I did not get a good look at any detail \"braces\" on the back and the poor photos don't show anything, but the color was definitive.   Yellow wash extends unbroken acros the throat and breast almost to the legs.  Streaked on flanks, not excessively.   Head has the typical gray triangular auriculars of a Blackburnian, but not very well defined in the back, which was smudgy yellow and gray.   Defining feature is the lengthy yellow supercilium extending all the way to the nape, and the lower eye crescent that appears white in the photos.   Combination of all of these traits ufficient to eliminate TOWA.  A couple things bother me about this bird however.  The photos seem to show a long tail with extendsive black on the sides, which is somewhat forked, kind of like a Parula.   None of this looks typical for either BLWA nor TOWA.  Also the bird has a somewhat well defined eye arcs in one of the photos though that may be a trick of the angle.  Considered other species.

Yellow wash extends unbroken acros the throat and breast almost to the legs.  Streaked on flanks, not excessively.   Head has the typical gray triangular auriculars of a Blackburnian, but not very well defined in the back, which was smudgy yellow and gray.   Defining feature is the lengthy yellow supercilium extending all the way to the nape, and the lower eye crescent that appears white in the photos.   Combination of all of these traits ufficient to eliminate TOWA.  A couple things bother me about this bird however.  The photos seem to show a long tail with extendsive black on the sides, which is somewhat forked, kind of like a Parula.   None of this looks typical for either BLWA nor TOWA.  Also the bird has a somewhat well defined eye arcs in one of the photos though that may be a trick of the angle.  Considered other species. Face pattern, black back and sharp white wing bar are all a good match for BLWA however.","Class":"","Order":"","Family":"","Parent Species":"Setophaga fusca","eBird Species Code":"bkbwar","Taxon Category":"Species","Taxonomic Sort":"32796.0","Recordist 2 Display Name":"","Recordist 2 Profile URL":"","Average Community Rating":"2.0","Number of Ratings":"1","Asset State":"committed","Asset Tags":"","Contributor Profile URL":"https://ebird.org/profile/MjMwNjE0","Original Image Height":"1067","Original Image Width":"1600","Specimen Page URL":"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/263099951","eBird Checklist URL":"https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S73643661","ebird Species URL":"https://ebird.org/species/bkbwar","isInternalUser":"false","mediaDownloadUrl":"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/","report_as":"bkbwar"}],"Species":"Blackburnian Warbler"},{"photos":[{"ML Catalog Number":"85243941","Format":"Photo","Scientific Name":"Setophaga petechia","Common Name":"Yellow Warbler","Background Species":"","Recordist":"Aaron Maizlish","Date":"9/3/2010","Year":"2010","Month":"9","Day":"3","Time":"1200","Country":"United States","Country-State-County":"US-CA-001","State":"California","County":"Alameda","Locality":"Emeryville Marina","Latitude":"37.8394","Longitude":"-122.3119","Elevation (m)":"","Age/Sex":"Unknown","Behaviors":"","Playback":"Unspecified","Collected":"","Specimen ID":"","Home Archive Catalog Number":"","Recorder":"","Microphone":"","Accessory":"","Partner Institution":"","eBird Checklist ID":"S9840855","Unconfirmed?":"","Air Temp(ºC)":"","Water Temp(ºC)":"","Media notes":"","Observation Details":"","Class":"","Order":"","Family":"","Parent Species":"Setophaga petechia","eBird Species Code":"yelwar","Taxon Category":"Species","Taxonomic Sort":"31756.0","Recordist 2 Display Name":"","Recordist 2 Profile URL":"","Average Community Rating":"3.5","Number of Ratings":"2","Asset State":"committed","Asset Tags":"","Contributor Profile URL":"https://ebird.org/profile/MjMwNjE0","Original Image Height":"1200","Original Image Width":"1800","Specimen Page URL":"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/85243941","eBird Checklist URL":"https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S9840855","ebird Species URL":"https://ebird.org/species/yelwar","isInternalUser":"false","mediaDownloadUrl":"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/","report_as":"yelwar"},{"ML Catalog Number":"192524531","Format":"Photo","Scientific Name":"Setophaga petechia","Common Name":"Yellow Warbler","Background Species":"","Recordist":"Aaron Maizlish","Date":"12/4/2019","Year":"2019","Month":"12","Day":"4","Time":"1052","Country":"United States","Country-State-County":"US-CA-075","State":"California","County":"San Francisco","Locality":"Lake Merced--Boathouse/Harding Park entrance drive","Latitude":"37.726","Longitude":"-122.5006","Elevation (m)":"","Age/Sex":"","Behaviors":"","Playback":"Unspecified","Collected":"","Specimen ID":"","Home Archive Catalog Number":"","Recorder":"","Microphone":"","Accessory":"","Partner Institution":"","eBird Checklist ID":"S61979855","Unconfirmed?":"","Air Temp(ºC)":"","Water Temp(ºC)":"","Media notes":"","Observation Details":"Presumed overwintering bird, as YEWA has overwintered here in past years.
