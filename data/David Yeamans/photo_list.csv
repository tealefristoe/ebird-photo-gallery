Note in particular the facial pattern including the full white line above the bill. This makes it not a LAWO but one of the two sapsuckers with a similar facial pattern, the RNSA and YBSA. Spots on the head rule out RNSA and rule in the YBSA. The YBSA can maintain juvenal plumage in early winter but the RNSA would have molted all of its juvenal plumage by now. A further separator is the all pale plumage of the belly in YBSA vs. speckled belly of the RNSA juvenile.  Why no white wing patch? This from Stephen Fettig explains: When sapsuckers get cold they seem to not show the white in the wing because the back feathers fluff-up and cover the wings more than in warmer times.  I remember this from other sapsuckers I have photographed in the winter.  So the lack of white in the wing is not an issue -- for me.  Photos by Dave Yeamans.

Two seen, a male red-shafted and a female intergrade. The under wing of the female intergrade was not orange but it wasn't all that yellow either. I'm inclined to call it flicker, intergrade, northern for the following reasons.  FLIN description for observation 2017-10-06 Del Valle Regional Park, Alameda County, California   09:41 a.m., forest shade on an open fire road with north-facing slope in a canyon, i.e. fair to good  light for visual observation and photos. No wind; full alto-cirrus sky.   The FLIN and one or more NOFL (the NOFL is clearly red-shafted based on nape, face, and head plumage [see photo]) were foraging on the roadway about 50 feet from me. I had noticed “these” birds an hour earlier as I hiked up the road and was keen to find them again, which I did as I returned to the location.   Two photos below show a flicker with no malar mark, hence, female. A red “nape crescent” is visible but this is much diminished from what I typically see on the yellow-shafted (I seek expert opinion on this YSFL mark, and yet I have extensive close up experience — photos on request — with this mark in the FLIN of New Mexico).   My attention was drawn to this bird by the not-very-orange but not-quite-yellow under wing coloration in flight. The photos do not show shaft colors, but they do show head color patterns that indicate RSFL. The face is gray and the crown is brown, clearly demarcated from each other. Sibley (Second Edition, Third Printing p. 320)** points out this mark for RSFL but exactly the opposite for YSFL. Interestingly, the head pattern for gilded flicker is an exact match for the bird shown in the photos. That match could indicate a third genotype present or a clinal variation among three varieties of Colaptes.  So here we have a NOFL with the clearly visible head pattern of a RSFL (or GIFL) but with the nape pattern of a YSFL . It also has (not photographed but true, based on the observer’s senses) racis coloration intermediate between YSFL and RSFL. The nomenclature of Flicker, Intergrade Northern  seems appropriate but not definitive. (OPINION: THE FLIN nomenclature seems more descriptive than Colaptes sp. which would imply a weaker observation or analysis.)     ** See also National Wildlife Federation, 2007, and National Geographic, Fifth edition.",,,,"Colaptes auratus",norfli,Species,11216.0,,,3.0,1,committed,,"https://ebird.org/profile/MTg0OTMz",898,1348,"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/70995791","https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S39584170","https://ebird.org/species/norfli",false,"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/",norfli

FLIN description for observation 2017-10-06 Del Valle Regional Park, Alameda County, California   09:41 a.m., forest shade on an open fire road with north-facing slope in a canyon, i.e. fair to good  light for visual observation and photos.

I had noticed “these” birds an hour earlier as I hiked up the road and was keen to find them again, which I did as I returned to the location.   Two photos below show a flicker with no malar mark, hence, female. A red “nape crescent” is visible but this is much diminished from what I typically see on the yellow-shafted (I seek expert opinion on this YSFL mark, and yet I have extensive close up experience — photos on request — with this mark in the FLIN of New Mexico).   My attention was drawn to this bird by the not-very-orange but not-quite-yellow under wing coloration in flight. The photos do not show shaft colors, but they do show head color patterns that indicate RSFL. The face is gray and the crown is brown, clearly demarcated from each other. Sibley (Second Edition, Third Printing p. 320)** points out this mark for RSFL but exactly the opposite for YSFL. Interestingly, the head pattern for gilded flicker is an exact match for the bird shown in the photos. That match could indicate a third genotype present or a clinal variation among three varieties of Colaptes.  So here we have a NOFL with the clearly visible head pattern of a RSFL (or GIFL) but with the nape pattern of a YSFL . It also has (not photographed but true, based on the observer’s senses) racis coloration intermediate between YSFL and RSFL. The nomenclature of Flicker, Intergrade Northern  seems appropriate but not definitive.

Note in particular the facial pattern including the full white line above the bill. This makes it not a LAWO but one of the two sapsuckers with a similar facial pattern, the RNSA and YBSA. Spots on the head rule out RNSA and rule in the YBSA. The YBSA can maintain juvenal plumage in early winter but the RNSA would have molted all of its juvenal plumage by now. A further separator is the all pale plumage of the belly in YBSA vs. speckled belly of the RNSA juvenile.  Why no white wing patch? This from Stephen Fettig explains: When sapsuckers get cold they seem to not show the white in the wing because the back feathers fluff-up and cover the wings more than in warmer times.  I remember this from other sapsuckers I have photographed in the winter.  So the lack of white in the wing is not an issue -- for me.  Photos by Dave Yeamans.
