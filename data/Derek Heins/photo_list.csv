It was moving around feeding, providing some nice comparisons to the Black-bellied Plovers.  Digiscoped.  My estimate is that this location is about midway between the two entry points to Eden Landing.

During the entire time we were there (25 minutes-ish), it probably didn't get more than 12 feet from the foot bridge.  Medium size sparrow with clean underparts, rufous on wing, gray nape.
