Same slender, slightly curved bill as Elegant Tern but with a lot of dark.  It also seems a bit smaller than ELTE's around it.    According to Sibley Guides ELTE should never show any black on the bill (https://www.sibleyguides.com/2007/08/sandwich-tern-bill-color-of-juveniles/).  And I cannot find any official documentation or study that proves pure Elegant Tern with dark on the bill.   Could this be one of the Bolsa Chica hybrid?   Comments on this hybrid sighting back 05/02/2014 (https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S18184838) from Kimball Garrett: ""There have to be some Sandwich Tern genes in this bird. Hybrid offspring have been raised at Bolsa Chica in past years, and Sandwich Tern has shown up in the massive Elegant colony on Isla Raza in the Gulf of California, so there are probably some F1 birds and backcrosses out there. I’ve seen elegants with much less dark on the bill than this that I’m convinced has some Sandwich influence. Interesting how the bill color looks so different in different photos. I doubt that “pure” Elegants ever show this much dark on the bill.""",,,,"Thalasseus sandvicensis x elegans",x00438,Hybrid,6500.0,,,4.0,1,committed,,"https://ebird.org/profile/Mjk3Nzc0",900,1350,"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/172538251","https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S58284728",,false,"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/",x00438

Same slender, slightly curved bill as Elegant Tern but with a lot of dark.  It also seems a bit smaller than ELTE's around it.    According to Sibley Guides ELTE should never show any black on the bill (https://www.sibleyguides.com/2007/08/sandwich-tern-bill-color-of-juveniles/).  And I cannot find any official documentation or study that proves pure Elegant Tern with dark on the bill.   Could this be one of the Bolsa Chica hybrid?   Comments on this hybrid sighting back 05/02/2014 (https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S18184838) from Kimball Garrett: ""There have to be some Sandwich Tern genes in this bird. Hybrid offspring have been raised at Bolsa Chica in past years, and Sandwich Tern has shown up in the massive Elegant colony on Isla Raza in the Gulf of California, so there are probably some F1 birds and backcrosses out there. I’ve seen elegants with much less dark on the bill than this that I’m convinced has some Sandwich influence. Interesting how the bill color looks so different in different photos.

I observed the bird from 2 different angles (north and east) and both spots are about 25-30 yards away from the bird so I can gain only distant shots. The bird is isolated and not bonding with other Semipalmated Plovers at all and spent most of the time preening.  I got better view of the bird today and can see the bill is longer, slander and with more orange on the base.  The white supercilium is very clear unlike a couple of adult female Semipalmated seen around the deck with weak pale supercilium.  The yellowish eyering is incomplete and mostly on the lower part of the eye.  The black band on the chest is not as wide as the normal male CRPL but I have seen some images (e.g. from Macaulay Library and Archive.org) of breeding plumage CRPL with narrow chest band.  No vocals from the bird again.  The plate contains images of CRPL and SEPL (A, D and G is the potential CRPL from today, H is a CRPL image from Archive for comparison, and the rest are SEPL seen in the area today).",,,,"Charadrius hiaticula",corplo,Species,5717.0,,,3.0,1,committed,,"https://ebird.org/profile/Mjk3Nzc0",434,624,"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/108392741","https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S47355069","https://ebird.org/species/corplo",false,"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/",corplo

I observed the bird from 2 different angles (north and east) and both spots are about 25-30 yards away from the bird so I can gain only distant shots. The bird is isolated and not bonding with other Semipalmated Plovers at all and spent most of the time preening.  I got better view of the bird today and can see the bill is longer, slander and with more orange on the base.  The white supercilium is very clear unlike a couple of adult female Semipalmated seen around the deck with weak pale supercilium.  The yellowish eyering is incomplete and mostly on the lower part of the eye.  The black band on the chest is not as wide as the normal male CRPL but I have seen some images (e.g. from Macaulay Library and Archive.org) of breeding plumage CRPL with narrow chest band.
