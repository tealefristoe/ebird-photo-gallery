Per Shunk in Peterson's guide to woodpeckers, presence or absence of red on nape isn't definitive for all individuals, however it lacks the solid black breast shield of an adult Red-naped, and Shunk, Dunn (Nat Geo, 6th ed), and Dunne (Pete Dunne's essential field guide companion) all agree that Red-naped have all completed formative molt by now. Shunk says that the solid breast patch is acquired as late as May of the second year in YBSA. Chin is red, with no white, indicating male. No red bleeds into submalar black stripe.  edit: upon reviewing photos, this is *not* the same individual photographed by Devin Peyton on Dec 27, less than a mile away. That one seems likely an adult female. https://ebird.org/checklist/S78103194  Also shows more red in crown and less black on throat than the one found at Lake Anza (2.5 miles away) by Charles Hargrove yesterday: https://ebird.org/checklist/S79091683, and refound by others, all showing a red throat. Interestingly, today Sam Zuckerman reports a female at the same location https://ebird.org/checklist/S79141061. This seems like an unusual number of YBSA to appear in such a small area (I saw one briefly in Claremont Canyon RP, 1 mile away 12/17, but was unable to obtain good looks or any photo).

Traditionally most birders have been using the middle of the creek as the line, if they've felt the need to track it at all (I don't for common birds, unless it's my first sighting for the county in that year. eBird policy is to use the county you spent most of your time in, if you crossed any boundary).

I doubt any of my recordings will be audible over the water, but it was slightly reminiscent of thrasher song (though faint and thinner-sounding). Bobbed almost constantly except when preening or giving a little wings-up display.

Per Shunk in Peterson's guide to woodpeckers, presence or absence of red on nape isn't definitive for all individuals, however it lacks the solid black breast shield of an adult Red-naped, and Shunk, Dunn (Nat Geo, 6th ed), and Dunne (Pete Dunne's essential field guide companion) all agree that Red-naped have all completed formative molt by now. Shunk says that the solid breast patch is acquired as late as May of the second year in YBSA. Chin is red, with no white, indicating male. No red bleeds into submalar black stripe.  edit: upon reviewing photos, this is *not* the same individual photographed by Devin Peyton on Dec 27, less than a mile away. That one seems likely an adult female. https://ebird.org/checklist/S78103194  Also shows more red in crown and less black on throat than the one found at Lake Anza (2.5 miles away) by Charles Hargrove yesterday: https://ebird.org/checklist/S79091683, and refound by others, all showing a red throat. Interestingly, today Sam Zuckerman reports a female at the same location https://ebird.org/checklist/S79141061. This seems like an unusual number of YBSA to appear in such a small area (I saw one briefly in Claremont Canyon RP, 1 mile away 12/17, but was unable to obtain good looks or any photo).
