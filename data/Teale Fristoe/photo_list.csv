Continuing since this morning in the same berry tree above Phillip's loop trail. Thanks Jim!  The bird's preferred tree actually appears to be a berry tree growing with a bay tree, creating some confusion. It has sapsucker wells in it which should help identify it.  The bird's plumage is pretty messy and I'm not sure of its identification. It clearly has a strong black and white facial pattern and a black bib, so it's not a pure Red-breasted Sapsucker. But the red crown and nape are extensive and blend with only a hint of black separating them, and there's a bit of red wash below the black bib. The red throat also appears to have a faint black outline all the way around it, which is a strike against pure Red-naped Sapsucker. Perhaps it's a Red-naped X Red-breasted hybrid? Or maybe it's just a juvenile male Red-naped molting into adult plumage and therefore looking a little scruffy.
