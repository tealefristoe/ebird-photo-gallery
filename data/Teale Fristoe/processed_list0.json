the continuing Ruff because it is strikingly gray compared to the other roosting Dowitchers and it has sloppy scapulars with a scaly appearance. I never saw its bill. Now I think it's probably a Dowitcher that's late in transitioning to breeding plumage, especially because of its white supercilium, just barely visible barred rump, and similar size to the birds near it. I welcome feedback on the identification. Either way the bird was along the southern edge of the northern pond, visible from the 15mph sign.","Class":"","Order":"","Family":"","Parent Species":"Limnodromus scolopaceus","eBird Species Code":"lobdow","Taxon Category":"Species","Taxonomic Sort":"5869.0","Recordist 2 Display Name":"","Recordist 2 Profile URL":"","Average Community Rating":"1.0","Number of Ratings":"1","Asset State":"committed","Asset Tags":"","Contributor Profile URL":"https://ebird.org/profile/NDE4MjM4","Original Image Height":"667","Original Image Width":"939","Specimen Page URL":"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/157605891","eBird Checklist URL":"https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S56093429","ebird Species URL":"https://ebird.org/species/lobdow","isInternalUser":"false","mediaDownloadUrl":"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/","report_as":"lobdow"}],"Species":"Long-billed Dowitcher"},{"photos":[{"ML Catalog Number":"268926211","Format":"Photo","Scientific Name":"Gallinago delicata","Common Name":"Wilson's Snipe","Background Species":"","Recordist":"Teale Fristoe","Date":"10/6/2020","Year":"2020","Month":"10","Day":"6","Time":"723","Country":"United States","Country-State-County":"US-CA-001","State":"California","County":"Alameda","Locality":"Coyote Hills Regional Park","Latitude":"37.5538","Longitude":"-122.0875","Elevation (m)":"","Age/Sex":"Unknown","Behaviors":"","Playback":"Unspecified","Collected":"","Specimen ID":"","Home Archive Catalog Number":"","Recorder":"","Microphone":"","Accessory":"","Partner Institution":"","eBird Checklist ID":"S74509836","Unconfirmed?":"","Air Temp(ºC)":"","Water Temp(ºC)":"","Media notes":"","Observation Details":"","Class":"","Order":"","Family":"","Parent Species":"Gallinago delicata","eBird Species Code":"wilsni1","Taxon Category":"Species","Taxonomic Sort":"5942.0","Recordist 2 Display Name":"","Recordist 2 Profile URL":"","Average Community Rating":"4.0","Number of Ratings":"1","Asset State":"committed","Asset Tags":"","Contributor Profile URL":"https://ebird.org/profile/NDE4MjM4","Original Image Height":"1825","Original Image Width":"2296","Specimen Page URL":"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/268926211","eBird Checklist URL":"https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S74509836","ebird Species URL":"https://ebird.org/species/wilsni1","isInternalUser":"false","mediaDownloadUrl":"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/","report_as":"wilsni1"},{"ML Catalog Number":"268926191","Format":"Photo","Scientific Name":"Gallinago delicata","Common Name":"Wilson's Snipe","Background Species":"","Recordist":"Teale Fristoe","Date":"10/6/2020","Year":"2020","Month":"10","Day":"6","Time":"723","Country":"United States","Country-State-County":"US-CA-001","State":"California","County":"Alameda","Locality":"Coyote Hills Regional Park","Latitude":"37.5538","Longitude":"-122.0875","Elevation (m)":"","Age/Sex":"Unknown","Behaviors":"","Playback":"Unspecified","Collected":"","Specimen ID":"","Home Archive Catalog Number":"","Recorder":"","Microphone":"","Accessory":"","Partner Institution":"","eBird Checklist ID":"S74509836","Unconfirmed?":"","Air Temp(ºC)":"","Water Temp(ºC)":"","Media notes":"","Observation Details":"","Class":"","Order":"","Family":"","Parent Species":"Gallinago delicata","eBird Species Code":"wilsni1","Taxon Category":"Species","Taxonomic Sort":"5942.0","Recordist 2 Display Name":"","Recordist 2 Profile URL":"","Average Community Rating":"4.0","Number of Ratings":"1","Asset State":"committed","Asset Tags":"","Contributor Profile URL":"https://ebird.org/profile/NDE4MjM4","Original Image Height":"1836","Original Image Width":"2546","Specimen Page URL":"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/268926191","eBird Checklist URL":"https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S74509836","ebird Species URL":"https://ebird.org/species/wilsni1","isInternalUser":"false","mediaDownloadUrl":"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/","report_as":"wilsni1"},{"ML Catalog Number":"184802351","Format":"Photo","Scientific Name":"Gallinago delicata","Common Name":"Wilson's Snipe","Background Species":"","Recordist":"Teale Fristoe","Date":"10/28/2019","Year":"2019","Month":"10","Day":"28","Time":"1014","Country":"United States","Country-State-County":"US-CA-041","State":"California","County":"Marin","Locality":"Pt.
