Still not certain on species but here are my thoughts based on the distinguishing characteristics listed by Kaufman in Field Guide to Advanced Birding. Crown: Brown with streaking and weak median stripe seems inconclusive for either Brewer's or Clay-colored but probably leaning Brewer's. Supercilium: Grayish, supporting Brewer's, but obviously distinct from crown and eye line, supporting Clay-colored. Doesn't appear to be invaded by streaking but edges don't appear to be very neat, so probably more leaning Brewer's. Malar: Dark lateral throat stripe with white submoustachial stripe point towards Clay-colored, maybe the strongest feature leaning in that direction. Neck and nape: Appears clean gray and contrasting with back crown color, supporting Clay-colored. However, in photos by other birders it looks like there is streaking on the back of the nape which points to Brewer's. Breast color: Appears grayish with no buffy tones, supporting Brewer's. Ear coverts: Strongly bordered not ruling out either species.  I think there was just one bird, but there might have been two. I encountered the bird(s) three times. Description in images indicate which encounter they are from.","Class":"","Order":"","Family":"","Parent Species":"Spizella breweri","eBird Species Code":"brespa","Taxon Category":"Species","Taxonomic Sort":"31751.0","Recordist 2 Display Name":"","Recordist 2 Profile URL":"","Average Community Rating":"2.0","Number of Ratings":"1","Asset State":"committed","Asset Tags":"","Contributor Profile URL":"https://ebird.org/profile/NDE4MjM4","Original Image Height":"1147","Original Image Width":"1308","Specimen Page URL":"https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/264643081","eBird Checklist URL":"https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S73879151","ebird Species URL":"https://ebird.org/species/brespa","isInternalUser":"false","mediaDownloadUrl":"https://cdn.download.ams.birds.cornell.edu/api/v1/asset/","report_as":"brespa"},{"ML Catalog Number":"264643031","Format":"Photo","Scientific Name":"Spizella breweri","Common Name":"Brewer's Sparrow","Background Species":"","Recordist":"Teale Fristoe","Date":"9/21/2020","Year":"2020","Month":"9","Day":"21","Time":"738","Country":"United States","Country-State-County":"US-CA-001","State":"California","County":"Alameda","Locality":"Cesar Chavez Park","Latitude":"37.8709","Longitude":"-122.315","Elevation (m)":"","Age/Sex":"Unknown","Behaviors":"","Playback":"Unspecified","Collected":"","Specimen ID":"","Home Archive Catalog Number":"","Recorder":"","Microphone":"","Accessory":"","Partner Institution":"","eBird Checklist ID":"S73879151","Unconfirmed?":"","Air Temp(ºC)":"","Water Temp(ºC)":"","Media notes":"Encounter 3","Observation Details":"Dull bird in fennel in north/nw part of park.

Shortly before 1pm one other birder and I saw flashes of an orange face and white stripes down the back. At around 1pm there was a brief but intense downpour which drove away two of the three other birders present. After the rain stopped, the Nelson's Sparrow popped up for nice views of the orange face, gray nape, and white stripes along its back. I'm hoping that the other birder present at this time will post better photos; I only got this single terrible one which shows the orange supercilium, malar, and breast and gray median crown stripe. The bird went down and afterwards we only saw movement as it occasionally darted from one shrub to another.","Class":"","Order":"","Family":"","Parent Species":"Ammospiza nelsoni","eBird Species
